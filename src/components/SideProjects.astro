      <a href="https://aptakube.com" target="_blank">Aptakube</a> is a fast,
      modern and multi-cluster desktop client for Kubernetes. I love using CLI
      for automation and scripting, but I prefer GUI apps for read heavy and
      adhoc tasks.

    <p>
      The core is written in Rust and the UI is Solid.js and TypeScript. Works
      on Windows, macOS and Linux.
