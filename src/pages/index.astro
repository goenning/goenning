      I'm a software developer passionate about the <span
        class="text-yellow-400">intersection of development and operations</span
      >. My area of interest and expertise includes Kubernetes, AWS,
      Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD, Developer Experience, Go, C# and much more.

    <p>
      I work as a <a href="/hire"
        >contractor<a></a> helping companies migrate, build and scale their
        cloud operations. When not coding, you'll find me running, cycling or
        swimming â€” sometimes all at once.
