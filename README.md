Hi, I'm goenning ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer passionate about the intersection of development and operations. My area of interest and expertise includes Kubernetes, AWS, Infra as Code, CI/CD, Developer Experience, Go, C#, React and much more.

I work as a contractor helping companies build and scale cloud native applications. When I'm not coding, you'll find me running, cycling or swimming â€” sometimes all at once.
